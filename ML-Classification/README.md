## Supervised Machine Learning: Classification Course

This repository contains the various notebooks completed during the course Supervised Machine Learning: Classification for IBM's Machine Learning Professional Certificate on Coursera.

### 1.1-Logistic_Regression_Error_Metrics with Human Activity Recognition with Smartphones Dataset

Prepares dataset for classification. Label encodes target variable, performs EDA on the dataset and then performs a train test split of data. Logistic Regression is performed for classification with regularization. Also plots confusion matrix for each model.

*Tools: Numpy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn*

### 1.2-Logistic_Regression with Food Items Dataset

Applies Logistic Regression. Involves preprocessing and generating training and testing datasets, training and fine-tuning logistic regression models, interpreting trained logistic regression models and evaluating trained logistic regression models.

*Tools: Numpy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn*

### 2.1-KNN with Customer Churn Dataset

Makes use of K-Nearest Neighbor or KNN model. Involves EDA, Data Preparation and Encoding as well as Data Scaling and data splitting. The split data is used to evaluate different KNN models with varying values of K (nearest neighbors). The results are evaluated and the best value of K is selected.

*Tools: Numpy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn*

### 2.2-KNN with Tumor Dataset

Involves training KNN models with different neighbor hyper-parameters (values of K), evaluating KNN models on classification tasks, tuning the number of neighbors and finding the optimized one for a specific task.

*Tools: Numpy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn*
