# Data-Projects
A repository containing various projects and microprojects for data analysis, data science and machine learning.

## AI-Keras
All microprojects and notebooks undertaken during the Coursera IBM Professional Certificate for AI Engineering for the course Introduction to Deep Learning and Neural Networks with Keras for Machine Learning. Includes a Final Project on comparing Neural Network models with different data preprocessing and model configurations.

## DA with R-Capstone
All microprojects and notebooks undertaken during the Coursera IBM Professional Certificate for Data Analytics with Excel and R for the course Data Science with R Capstone Project. The final project involves running a data analysis on Seoul Bike demand dataset along with weather data to determine number of bike rentals. Trends and patterns in bike rentals and weather and seasonal phenomenon are identified and visualized. Subsequently, a linear regression model is trained to predict bike rental demand with weather and seasonal features.

## DA-Capstone
All microprojects and notebooks undertaken during the Coursera IBM Professional Certificate for Data Analyst for the course Data Analyst Capstone Project. The final project involves running a data analysis on Stack Overflow Developer Survey 2019 to identify and visualize different trends in various areas of the technology sector. The Final Presentation contains all the relevant insights derived from the dataset.

## DS-Capstone
All microprojects and notebooks undertaken during the Coursera IBM Professional Certificate for Data Scientist for the course Applied Data Science Capstone Project. For the capstone project, data about rocket launches of SpaceX are analysed to determine what factors contribute to the success and failure of a launch. Furthermore, several machine learning models are trained to determine how successful a launch can be based on certain features. The results along with other details are available in the Final Presentation.

## ML-Classification
All microprojects and notebooks undertaken during the Coursera IBM Professional Certificate for Machine Learning for the course Supervised Machine Learning: Classification. Includes a Final Project and Final Project Report covering the use of Undersampling in Multi-label classification with Forest Cover Dataset.

## ML-Deep Learning
All microprojects and notebooks undertaken during the Coursera IBM Professional Certificate for Machine Learning for the course Deep Learning and Reinforcement Learning. Includes a Final Project and Final Project Report on using Neural Networks to classify pistachios based on extracted features from images.

## ML-EDA
All microprojects and notebooks undertaken during the Coursera IBM Professional Certificate for Machine Learning for the course Exploratory Data Analysis for Machine Learning. Includes a Final Project and Final Project Report on conducting EDA and Hypothesis Testing on Coursera courses dataset.

## ML-Final Project
All microprojects and notebooks undertaken during the Coursera IBM Professional Certificate for Machine Learning for the course Machine Learning Capstone. The capstone is a major project on creating a Course Recommender System. It includes conducting EDA on a courses dataset, applying machine learning models to the courses dataset and creating an application using the Course Recommender System.

## ML-Regression
All microprojects and notebooks undertaken during the Coursera IBM Professional Certificate for Machine Learning for the course Supervised Machine Learning: Regression. Includes a Final Project and Final Project Report on conducting multiple regression analyses on Life Expectancy Dataset.

## ML-Time Series and Survival Analysis
All microprojects and notebooks undertaken during the Coursera IBM Professional Certificate for Machine Learning for the course Time Series and Survival Analysis. Includes a Final Project and Final Project Report on making use of Survival Analysis to understand impact of different herbicides on bee populations.

## ML-Unsupervised Learning
All microprojects and notebooks undertaken during the Coursera IBM Professional Certificate for Machine Learning for the course Unsupervised Machine Learning. Includes a Final Project and Final Project Report. The Final Project uses Countries dataset from an NGO to cluster countries on the basis of socio-economic factors.
