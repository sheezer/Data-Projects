# IBM Data Analyst Professional Certificate
## Data Analyst Capstone Project

This repository contains the various notebooks and the final presentation completed during the course Data Analyst Capstone Project for IBM's Data Analyst Professional Certificate on Coursera. The Capstone project revolves around analysing and visualizing jobs data about the tech industry.


### 1-1-Web-Scraping Review
A review of the basic concepts of web scraping and using Beautiful Soup to process html data.

*Tools: Beautiful Soup, requests*

### 1-2-Web-Scraping-Lab
A lab in which computer language use and average salary for each language data from a website is scrapped and processed for additional use.

*Tools: Beautiful Soup, requests*

### 1-3-Accessing_APIs_review
A review of the HTTP, REST APIs and querying APIs using the requests library.

*Tools: requests*

### 1-4-Jobs_API
To be run before using the next notebook. Uses a Flask app to get data for subsequent use.

### 1-5-Collecting_Jobs_data
To be run after the Jobs_API notebook. Starts off with querying an API to get data on astronauts on the ISS. Afterwards, an API at a link is queried to get jobs data on the tech industry. Processes the data so that it is available in a more readily usable format.

*Tools: requests*

### 1-6-M1ExploreDataSet
Explores the Jobs Survey dataset that will be used throughout the capstone.

*Tools: Pandas*

### 2-M2DataWrangling
Performs data wrangling on the Jobs Survey dataset so that duplicates and missing values are removed or replaced where possible. Furthermore, the data is normalized for easier comparisons later.

*Tools: Pandas*

### 3-M3ExploratoryDataAnalysis
Performs Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the dataset. Identifies the data distribution, locates the outliers and removes them and looks for correlations between features in the dataset.

*Tools: Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn*

### 4-M4DataVisualization
Visualizes different aspects of the dataset's features. Creates charts for important relationships. Also uses sqlite3 to query the dataset so that relevant data is easily acquired for plotting.

*Tools: Plotly, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Pandas, sqlite*

### Final Presentation
The final presentation for the capstone project. Includes details of the analysis performed on the Jobs Survey dataset as well as several charts illustrating important trends about the technology sector. Discusses the findings of the project as well.
