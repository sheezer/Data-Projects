# IBM AI Engineering Professional Certificate
## Introduction to Deep Learning and Neural Networks with Keras

This repository contains the various notebooks completed during the course AI Capstone Project with Deep Learning for IBM's AI Engineering Professional Certificate on Coursera.

### 1-1-Loading-Data

Downloads and visualizes the concrete crack images dataset. This dataset will be later used for training models in the project.

*Tools: Numpy, Matplotlib, PIL(Pillow)*

### 1-2-load_and_display_data

Loads the concrete crack images dataset and visualizes it. The dataset will be used later in the project.

*Tools: Numpy, Matplotlib, PIL(Pillow), Pandas*

### 2-1-Data-Preparation

Uses the Keras library to convert the concrete crack images dataset into batches which may be processed later in the project.

*Tools: Numpy, Matplotlib, Keras*

### 2-2-data-loader


Uses PyTorch to split the concrete crack images dataset into training and validation sets. Afterwards, a Dataset class object is defined for the image dataset to automatically split the data.

*Tools: Numpy, Matplotlib, PyTorch*

### 3-1-Pretrained_Models

Makes use of the pretrained resnet50 model from Keras to train a classifier for the concrete crack images dataset. The input data (concrete crack images) is rescaled for the resnet50 model and the output layer of the resnet50 model is replaced for the available dataset. The model is then trained.

*Tools: Numpy, Matplotlib, Keras*
