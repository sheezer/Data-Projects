### Clustering Final Project Notebook

The final project uses a dataset containing socioeconomic data on countries of the world. It is provided by an NGO (Non-Governmental Organisation) HELP International. The dataset used for the project can be found at: [Dataset Link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rohan0301/unsupervised-learning-on-country-data)

The project uses different clustering techniques on the dataset to determine if it is possible to cluster countries that suffer from lower socio-economic conditions.
