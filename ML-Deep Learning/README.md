This repository contains the various notebooks completed during the course Deep Learning for IBM's Machine Learning Professional Certificate on Coursera.

### 1.1-Gradient_Descent

Provides an explanation of Gradient Descent.

*Tools: Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn*

### 1.2-Neural Networks

Discusses neural networks covering the Sigmoid function and logic gates.

*Tools: Numpy, Matplotlib*

### 1.3-Backpropagation

Looks at the phenomenon of Backpropagation and applies it to a neural network.

*Tools: Numpy, Matplotlib*

### 2-Introduction to Keras

Introduces the Keras library. Makes use of Keras library to build neural networks. Uses Keras and Neural Networks for classification problems.

*Tools: Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn, Seaborn, Keras*

### 3.1-Convolutional Neural Network

Uses Keras library to create a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). Applies the CNN on the CIFAR-10 dataset for classification of image objects.

*Tools: Keras*

### 3.2-Transfer_Learning

Uses the Keras library to create a CNN and trains it on half of the MNIST dataset on digits 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9. Subsequently, Transfer Learning is used to train the model's final layers on digits 0, 1, 2, 3 and 4.

*Tools: Keras, Datetime*

### 4-Recurrent Neural Networks

Uses the Keras library to create a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN). Applies the RNN on the IMDB reviews dataset.

*Tools: Keras*

### 5-Autoencoders

Implements various dimenionality reduction techniques on the MNIST dataset including PCA, Autoencoders and Variational Autoencoders. Uses appropriate scoring metrics to compare the performance of each.

*Tools: Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn, Keras, Tensorflow*

### 6-Reinforcement Learning

Discusses Reinforcement Learning. Uses machine learning tools to determine how an agent should act. The tools are subsequently used to drive the behavior of the agent.

*Tools: Numpy, Pandas, Gym*

### Deep Learning Final Project Notebook

The final project uses features collected from images of pistachios. There are two variants of the data. One is a dataset including all 28 features used for classifying different species of pistachios. The other is the same dataset with only 16 features. The other features are dropped. The datasets can be found at [Datasets Link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/muratkokludataset/pistachio-image-dataset)

The project makes use of Neural Networks with varying number of hidden layers to make predictions about the species of pistachios, classifying them accordingly.The impact of number of features and number of hidden layers on classification accuracy is noted.

*Tools: Pandas, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn, Keras, Seaborn*

### Deep Learning Final Project Report

The report on the final project involving Deep Learning. It discusses the results from applying varying hidden layers on the different datasets.
