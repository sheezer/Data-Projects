## Specialized Models: Time Series and Survival Analysis Course

This repository contains the various notebooks completed during the course Specialized Models: Time Series and Survival Analysis for IBM's Machine Learning Professional Certificate on Coursera.

### 1.1-Pandas_Time_Series

Focuses on understanding time series applications for NumPy and Pandas, summarizing a dataframe with a datetime index and generating simple time series plots.

*Tools: Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Datetime, Dateutil*

### 1.2-Decomposition

Provides a practical understanding of the three components of time series data, a better understanding of additive and multiplicative models and a simple way to decompose time series data in Python.

*Tools: Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Statsmodels*

### 2.1-Stationarity

Provides a practical understanding of what it means for time series to be stationary, a better understanding of ways to identify stationarity and several common ways to transform nonstationary time series data.

*Tools: Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Statsmodels*

### 2.2-Smoothing

Provides a practical understanding of smoothing and why it is necessary, several common smoothing techniques and a basic understanding of how to smooth time series data with Python and generate forecasts.

*Tools: Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Statsmodels*

### 3.1-ARMA

Provides a practical understanding of Autoregressive (AR) models, a practical understanding of Moving Average (MA) models, a basic understanding of the Autocorrelation Function (ACF), a basic understanding of the Partial Autocorrelation Function (PACF), insight into choosing the order q of MA models and insight into choosing the order p of AR models.

*Tools: Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Statsmodels*

### 3.2-SARIMA and FbProphet

Provides a practical understanding of Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) models, insight into checking fit of model, learn to create forecasts with ARIMA models in Python, a practical understanding of fbprophet, how to check fit of fbprophet model and means of adjusting and improving fbprophet model parameters.

*Tools :Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Statsmodels, Datetime, Fbprophet, Pmdarima*

### 4.1-Deep_Learning and Time_Series_Analysis

Provides a practical understanding of how to build and train a simple RNN (Rescurrent Neural Networks) and LSTM (Long Short Term Memory) model for time series forecasting, using Keras and an introductory experience in tuning RNN/LSTM parameters.

*Tools: Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, Datetime, Keras, Tensorflow*

### 4.2-Survival Analysis

Provides an understanding of how to approach Survival Analysis, knowing how to prepare Kaplan-Meier curves for various subgroups and running a basic Cox survival regression.

*Tools: Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Lifelines*

### Survival Analysis Final Project Notebook

The final project involves performing survival analysis on datasets of experiments run on bee colonies and the impact of various herbicides on them. The datasets can be found at: [Datasets Link](https://qubeshub.org/publications/2989/2)

The final project measures the impact of different herbicides on bee population, including supposedly 'bee-friendly' herbicides. The results are used to determine which herbicides are harmful to bees. The bees used in the experiments were bumblebees.

*Tools: Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly, Lifelines*

### Survival Analysis Final Project Report

A project report for the final project on Survival Analysis. Discusses the details of the project as well as the results indicating which herbicides are harmful to bees and which are not.
