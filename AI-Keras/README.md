## Introduction to Deep Learning and Neural Networks with Keras

This repository contains the various notebooks completed during the course Introduction to Deep Learning and Neural Networks with Keras for IBM's AI Engineering Professional Certificate on Coursera.

### 1-1-Forward-Propagation

Discusses the basic concepts involved in a neural network (NN) followed by the implementation of basic functions of NN using simple Python code. Sunsequently, uses these functions to create a multi-layer perceptron.
*Tools: Numpy, Random*


### 3-1-Regression with Keras

Uses the Concrete strength dataset. First, Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is performed on the dataset. Then Keras is used to make a neural network model for Regression using the features provided to determine their impact on the strength of the concrete.
*Tools: Numpy, Pandas, Keras*

### 3-2-Classification with Keras

Makes use of the MNIST dataset. First, EDA is performed on the dataset and the underlying handwritten image is displayed using matplotlib. Then, some feature engineering is performed to prepare the data for classification. Afterwards, Keras is sued to create a neural network for classification and the network is trained on the data.
*Tools: Numpy, Pandas, Keras, Matplotlib*
