## Introduction to Deep Learning and Neural Networks with Keras

This repository contains the various notebooks completed during the course Introduction to Deep Learning and Neural Networks with Keras for IBM's AI Engineering Professional Certificate on Coursera.

### 1-1-Forward-Propagation

Discusses the basic concepts involved in a neural network (NN) followed by the implementation of basic functions of NN using simple Python code. Sunsequently, uses these functions to create a multi-layer perceptron.

*Tools: Numpy, Random*

### 3-1-Regression with Keras

Uses the Concrete strength dataset. First, Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is performed on the dataset. Then Keras is used to make a neural network model for Regression using the features provided to determine their impact on the strength of the concrete.

*Tools: Numpy, Pandas, Keras*

### 3-2-Classification with Keras

Makes use of the MNIST dataset. First, EDA is performed on the dataset and the underlying handwritten image is displayed using matplotlib. Then, some feature engineering is performed to prepare the data for classification. Afterwards, Keras is used to create a neural network for classification and the network is trained on the data.

*Tools: Numpy, Pandas, Keras, Matplotlib*

### 4-1-Convolutional Neural Network with Keras

Makes use of the MNIST dataset. First, the basics of a convolutional neural network are discussed. Then Keras is used to create the different layers of a basic convolutional neural network. Finally, the constructed convolutional neural network is sued on the MNIST dataset after the data has been prepared with feature engineering.

*Tools: Numpy, Pandas, Keras, Matplotlib*

### P-A- Final Project Baseline

The final project involves using the concrete dataset for regression by making use of a Keras designed neural network. The baseline model is a simple nural network with one hidden layer. Its performance is noted using metrics from Scikit-learn.

*Tools: Numpy, Pandas, Keras, Scikit-Learn*

### P-B- Final Project Normalized

The final project involves using the concrete dataset for regression by making use of a Keras designed neural network. The normalized model uses the same neural network as the baseline model but makes use of normalized features data. Its performance is noted using metrics from Scikit-learn.

*Tools: Numpy, Pandas, Keras, Scikit-Learn*

### P-C- Final Project 100 epochs

The final project involves using the concrete dataset for regression by making use of a Keras designed neural network. The 100 epochs model is the same as the baseline model but trains the neural network for a longer time period (100 epochs). Its performance is noted using metrics from Scikit-learn.

*Tools: Numpy, Pandas, Keras, Scikit-Learn*

### P-D- Final Project Complex

The final project involves using the concrete dataset for regression by making use of a Keras designed neural network. The complex model makes use of a neural network with more hidden layers for training. Its performance is noted using metrics from Scikit-learn.

*Tools: Numpy, Pandas, Keras, Scikit-Learn*
