## Introduction to Deep Learning and Neural Networks with Keras

This repository contains the various notebooks completed during the course Introduction to Deep Learning and Neural Networks with Keras for IBM's AI Engineering Professional Certificate on Coursera.

### 1-1-Forward-Propagation

Discusses the basic concepts involved in a neural network (NN) followed by the implementation of basic functions of NN using simple Python code. Sunsequently, uses these functions to create a multi-layer perceptron.
_Tools: Numpy, Random_

### Regressin with Keras
