## Supervised Machine Learning: Regression Course

This repository contains the various notebooks completed during the course Supervised Machine Learning: Regression for IBM's Machine Learning Professional Certificate on Coursera.

### 1.1- Transforming Target with Boston Dataset

Transform target variables in a dataset in preparation for regression. Includes how to apply transformations to make target variable more normally distributed for regression and apply inverse transformations to be able to use these in a regression context.

*Tools: Numpy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib*

### 1.2- Linear Regression with Car Price Dataset

Applies linear regression to the car price dataset. This involves selecting significant features based on a visual analysis, checking assumptions for a linear regression model, applying linear regression model to make predictions of car prices based on different feature combinations and applying pipelines for data transformation. 

*Tools: Numpy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Seaborn, Scipy, Matplotlib, Itertools*
